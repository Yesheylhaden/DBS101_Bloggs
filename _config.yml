title: "Hello, world! I'm Yeshey Lhaden"
description: > 
  Welcome to my blog! This is where I’ll be documenting the knowledge I gain 
  after completing each unit of the DBS101 (Database Systems) module. It will 
  serve as the perfect place for me to reflect on key takeaways and challenges 
  that shape my understanding. This blog is my journal, capturing my thoughts, 
  experiences, and learning process. From new concepts in databases to problem-solving 
  and personal growth, I aim to offer a unique perspective on what I’ve learned, 
  the mistakes I’ve made, and how I’ve overcome them. Join me on my journey as I 
  continue to grow as a software engineer.
